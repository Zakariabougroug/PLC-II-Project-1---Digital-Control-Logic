# PLC-II-Project-1---Digital-Control-Logic

10 Projects in PLC programming: 

1. Digtal Control Logic: Maintaining the pressure-level within a tank. 
2. Digital Filling Station: Filling Station - Fully automated with factory-style instruments. 
3. Inventory Management: Creating a Barcode scanner that manages incoming and outgoing materials. 
4. Multisensor Servo Application: A cycling water treatment system. 
5. Rotameter: A system measuring oil-flow using a rotameter. 
6. Hourmeter: A system that tracks runtime of a host plant (0 seconds - 1000 hours)
7. Sensor Calibration: A system calibrating an O2 sensor in a coal mine. 
8. PID Substitution Logic: A program for a Vacuum system, holding a setpoint without using a PID controller.
9. Dynaminc Data Exchange (DDE) Messaging: A system that stores the modes of a Process and sends the data to an Excel Spreadsheet dynamically.  
10. Pump Protection: An Alarm System with Hand ON Auto (HOA) control enabled on a pump with a flow- and pressure switch.
